Specifications for the Sinatra Assessment
Specs:

  X      Use Sinatra to build the app - I used CRUD and MVC logic. 
  X      Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database _ I used AC to create my migrations and databse.
  X      Include more than one model class (e.g. User, Post, Category) - I did create two models. One user and one workout.
  X      Include at least one has_many relationship on your User model (e.g. User has_many Posts) - The user has the many relationship.
  X      Include at least one belongs_to relationship on another model (e.g. Post belongs_to User) - The workout has the belongs to relationship.
  X      Include user accounts with unique login attribute (username or email) - A person can log in with their username and password and create an account with the same info.
  X      Ensure that the belongs_to resource has routes for Creating, Reading, Updating and Destroying - The CRUD was used with the restful routes to perform the operations.
  X      Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users - A user can only see their account. Not other accounts.
  X      Include user input validations - A user must input correct information or else an error will arise.
  X      BONUS - not required - Display validation failures to user with error message (example form URL e.g. /posts/new) - Error messages are created in the views.
  X      Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code - It is according to specs.
  X      Confirm - Yes

  X      You have a large number of small Git commits - I did commit everytime I worked on one part of MVC.
  X      Your commit messages are meaningful - Yes they are.
  X      You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message - Yes they do.
  X      You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message - My changes are relatable.
